## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 9700caa: add a default value for the api key in prompt

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 574a69e: # New Features
  This version adds explicit support to Perplexity and Ollama, and also a new backend called `custom`. The `custom` backend allows you to add your own OpenAI API supported backend to Commit Companion. Even though I did not tested it, it's very possible that it will work with GPT API as well.

  # Technicalities

  - Added support to `perplexity`, `custom` and `ollama` as backends.
  - Refactored the `setup` command, now it's more user-friendly.
  - Started using the `openai` package to process the requests. This will make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
