This is a simple CLI tool that gets the git diff of the staged files and generates a commit message through one of the [supported models from Perplexity AI](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/model-cards).

Highly inspired by [AI Commits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits), where I get the prompt for the commit message and the diff of the staged files.
